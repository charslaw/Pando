# Examples

These are some small, isolated examples to show a state tree node and an example serializer for serializing the node.

- [Person example](person-example.md):
  illustrates a simple node that only contains primitive data.
- [Company example](company-example.md):
  illustrates a more complex compound node that contains both primitive data as well as a collection of other nodes.
